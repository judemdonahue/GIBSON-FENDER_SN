// 1975-1977

// 99xxxxxx - 1975
// 00xxxxxx - 1976
// 06xxxxxx = 1977



// Following 1977, the primary serialization method is introduced

// YDDDYRRR
// YY is the production year
// DDD is the day of the year
// RRR is the factory ranking/plant designation number.
// Prior to 1984 when the Kalamazoo, MI factory was closed, the numbers 001-499 indicated Kalamazoo production. Ranking numbers 500-999 continued to indicate Nashville production through 1989.



// After 1989, all acoustics are made in Bozeman, MT and all electrics are built in Nashville or Memphis.

// RRR numbers for acoustics start each day at 001
// RRR numbers for electrics may start as low as the 300s
// Examples:
// 70108276 means the instrument was produced on Jan. 10, 1978, in Kalamazoo and was the 276th instrument stamped that day.
// 82765501 means the instrument was produced on Oct. 3, 1985, in Nashville and was the 1st instrument stamped that day.



// In July 2005, a 9 digit SN is used

// The sixth number is now a batch number- batch 0 starts at the beginning of the day, and once we stamp 699
// the batch number will change to 1. The first 5 numbers remain the same, the last 3 numbers will remain the same. The only difference is the addition of this batch indicator.
// xxxxx0xxx

// EXCEPTION: !!
// Most Les Paul classics ranging from 1989-2014 will contain a 5-6 digit SN, but the earliest examples featuring 4 digit SNs
// There should be a space after the 1st digit with the 4 and 5 digit serial numbers, and no space with the 6 digit numbers.
// Examples -
// 9 xxx = 1989 (4 digit number beginning with "9" used only in 1989)
// 0 xxxx = 1990
// 9 xxxx = 1999
// 00xxxx = 2000
// 05xxxx = 2005
